In this project, I used standardized test performance (SAT) data from NYC's public schools to identify the schools with top math results, look at how performance varies by borough, and find the city's top ten performing schools. Using data manipulation and summary statistics to analyze test scores across New York City's public schools!


<h2> I'm trying to answer these business questions: </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Which NYC schools have the best math results?</li>
  <li> What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?</li>
  <li>Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?<li>
</ul>
